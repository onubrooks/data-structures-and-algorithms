# data-structures-and-algorithms

Welcome to this repository. 
Here I demonstrate some of the most common data structures and algorithms problems in computer science that I have learned and practiced. I try to implement both Python and Javascript solutions in most cases.

Feel free to clone, fork or contribute in anyway to the repo. Questions and suggestions are also welcome.
