Which sorting algorithm would you use for each of these scenarios?

#1 - Sort 10 schools around your house by distance: 
Insertion sort performs well on small data

#2 - eBay sorts listings by the current Bid amount: 
Radix or Counting sort since a bid is usually a fixed length/range integer eg 1 to 1k USD

#3 - Sport scores on ESPN: 
Quick sort for better memory efficiency

#4 - Massive database (can't fit all into memory) needs to sort through past year's user data: 
Merge sort - Data is so big and we are sorting out of memory so merging of various batches is possible

#5 - Almost sorted Udemy review data needs to update and add 2 new reviews: 
Insertion sort works well with almost sorted data

#6 - Temperature Records for the past 50 years in Canada: 
Quick sort for better memory efficiency
Radix or Counting if temperature data has no decimals

#7 - Large user name database needs to be sorted, data is very random: 
Quick or Merge sort depending on memory availability or if we are worried about worst case pivot.

#8 - You want to teach sorting for the first time: Bubble or Selection sort
